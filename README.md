# MUSIFY - Music Composition using AI

This project, **MUSIFY**, allows you to create original piano compositions using Artificial Intelligence.

## Project Overview

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Music21, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn, tqdm
- **Dataset Source:** [Classical Music MIDI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi)

## Project Structure

- **All Midi Files/:** A collection of MIDI files from various composers.
- **code.ipynb:** The workspace for building and training the AI model.
- **MOD/:** Contains optimizer settings, metrics, and trained model weights.
- **AI_composed_music.mid:** A musical composition generated by the AI.
- **Musify_Presentation.pdf:** A presentation highlighting project insights.

## Quick Start Guide

To compose music using AI:

1. **Download:** Obtain the project files by clicking "Code."
2. **Install Dependencies:** Use the Anaconda Prompt to install necessary libraries.
3. **Open the Notebook:** Access `compose_music.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
4. **Execute the Cells:** Run each cell sequentially to build and train the AI model.
5. **Training Time:** Please be patient as model training takes approximately 7-8 hours.
6. **Generate Music:** Execute the final cell to save your composition as `AI_composed_music.mid`.
7. **Listen:** Enjoy your unique musical creation.

Fine-tune parameters in the code to customize your musical results.
